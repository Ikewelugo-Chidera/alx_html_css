Welcome! This is a simple but carefully crafted *responsive web page* built using only *HTML and CSS* — no JavaScript, no CSS frameworks. It was created as part of my learning journey with the ALX Front-End curriculum.

The goal? Recreate a professional UI design from a Figma file and bring it to life using only the core tools of the web: HTML and CSS.

## 🌍 About the Project

This web page is based on a beautiful design by *Nicolas Philippot*, shared via Figma. The focus is not just on making it look right, but also:
- Building a responsive layout that works on both desktop and mobile
- Applying accessibility best practices
- Styling from scratch without shortcuts or libraries

---

## 💡 Features

- ✅ *Responsive design*: Adapts perfectly to smaller screens (mobile view activates at 480px and below)
- 🎯 *Max content width*: 1000px, neatly centered on larger screens
- 🔗 *Link hover/active color*: #FF6565
- 🔘 *Button hover/active effect*: Subtle opacity change (0.9)
- 💅 Built from the ground up using only semantic *HTML* and modern *CSS*

📌 Notes

No external CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap) were used.

No JavaScript required — everything is done with HTML/CSS.

Some Figma font sizes/values were slightly rounded for simplicity.
